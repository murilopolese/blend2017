					<p>
						This party is carefully curated and created with much love by a small
						group of people: <a href="http://jrcanest.co/" target="_blank">Jorge</a>,
						<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/teresatoews" target="_blank">Teresa</a>,
						<a href="http://www.claudiosalas.com/" target="_blank">Claudio</a> &
						<a href="http://www.sandervandijk.tv/" target="_blank">Sander</a>.
						They wanted to create a place for their motion, design &
						animation family to call home; to make aâ€‹ festival for the community,
						by the community. Always trying to keep it small, without any
						sponsors behind it, trying to break even, and hoping to create a
						festival that each one of them would love to attend.
					</p>
					<p>
						It all began when Jorge & Claudio started a vimeo channel called
						<a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/wineaftercoffee" target="_blank">WINE after COFFEE</a>,
						curating their favorite videos in one place. That channel grew and
						grew, and today has over 30K followers. This was all
						online, and the idea to bring this amazing community to the real
						world was incredibly exciting. So Blend was born. You can read more
						about its conception <a href="http://motionographer.com/2015/08/26/from-online-to-real-life-the-origins-of-wine-after-coffee-and-blend/" target="_blank">here</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The heart of Blend and WINE after COFFEE is to be a place, online
						and offline, where people from all around the world come to share
						awesome work, get inspired, learn, and collaborate. Because when we
						get together, amazing things happen.
